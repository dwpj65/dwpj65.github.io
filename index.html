    <p>At present, there is not much to see here. I have a fair number of personal projects that I am working on at present, and may upload them (or parts thereof) as they become more presentable.</p>
    <p>Until then, you may enjoy browsing my <a href="https://gist.github.com/dwpj65/edd48cbf20726217f49447718310292b" target="_new">Python Notes</a>. I've been playing with Python since March of 2020, and this document is where I store snippets and other information I find useful in my pursuit of Python.</p>
